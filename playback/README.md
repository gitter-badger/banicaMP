#Core components to the player
This is where the player actually plays and handles the songs
##`play`
Here is where the audio gets processed and played. Platform-specific things, partially documented, each platform should have a README file like this --or hopefully a better one--.
##`playlist`
The playlist handler. I will elaborate on this at a later date.
